### HW2 - Units converter for speed, pressure and radioactivity:

The program takes physical ? from user in an infinite cycle. Then it asks for original units and print the result (the lower or upper case, accordingly). The tool works **only with nucleic acid sequences**!

Possible commands:

**speed** — termination of the program, **pressure** — print transcribed sequence (input 5'-3' -> output 3'-5', **only for DNA!**), **radioactivity** — print reverse sequence, **complement** — print complement sequence, **reverse complement** — print reverse complement sequence.
