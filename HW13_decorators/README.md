## HW13 - Decorators for functions

```measure_time()``` - a simple decorator, that changes the output of the function to its working time

```function_logging()``` - a decorator, that prints function's input and the type of output value

```russian_roulette_decorator()``` -  returns decorator's input (```return_value```) instead of function's output (with defined ```probability```)
