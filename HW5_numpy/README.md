## HW5 - Numpy functions for multiplication of matrixes and distance calculations

- **matrix_multiplication:** accepts 2 matrixes and multiplies them
- **multiplication_check:** accepts a list of matrixes and prints "True", if they could be multiplied as they are ordered in the list,
 and "False", if they could not be multiplied
- **multiply_matrices:** accepts a list of matrixes and returns a result of multiplication, if it exists, or "None", if multiplication is not possible
- **compute_2d_distance:** accepts 2 1d-arrays with coordinates and calculates the distance
- **compute_multidimensional_distance:** accepts 2 1d-arrays with any number of coordinates (the same in both!) and calculates the distance
- **compute_pair_distances:** accepts 2d arrays, where rows are observations and columns are features, and returns the pairwise-distance matrix
