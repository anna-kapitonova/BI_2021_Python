**Tasks:**
1. Create a small class with a constructor and several methods ("Dogs").
2. Create a class, describing RNA, including translation and reverse transcription method.

- count the number of sequences
- gc-count
- executing all methods for counting
- a histogram for sequence length distribution
- a histogram for frequences of 4-mers (x - 4mer, y - frequency)
